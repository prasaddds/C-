//stl:- library of generic classes and function.
/*
we can use well tested components
Time saving
components of stl:- 
a)containers:-object which stores data. uses template classes
	1)sequence containers:-stores data in linear fashion. vectors,lists,Dequeue,vector:-random sccess,insertion/del at last is fast,insertion/del at middle slow
	list:-RA-slow,insertion at middle-fast,insert at end-fast,del/insertion at middle-fast
	2)Associative containers:-all operations fast except RA,Direct access,fast search, fast access.map,multimap,set,multiset
	3)Derived containers:-depends on ds,Real world modelling
b)algorithms:- procedure to process data
c)iterators:-object points to an element in a container. just like pointers
->connects algorithms with pointers
stl is used coz its good idea not to reinvent the idea
