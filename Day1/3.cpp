//variables:- variables are like containers used to store data
//A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. 
//The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
//A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.
//In C++, all the variables must be declared before use.
//statically typed language
