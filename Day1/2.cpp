#include<iostream>//one of the header file, helps in input,output,
//library which contains so many predefined functions. we can use them
//directly by calling that particular function without bothering about code 
//contains. #include says that files need to be processed before compilation
//1)predefined, user defined
int main()//main is entry point . execution of program starts from main function
{//tells that this is a strating point of main function 
	//return type
	std::cout<<"Hello World";//function body, << inserting data into output stream
	return 0;//if the program return 0, it have no errors
	//indicates successful termination of a program without errros
}
//::scope resolution
//>> extraction operator used for input, extractiong data from input stream
//C is not privacy
//some new data types are added in c++:- class,reference,boolean
//some operators were added in c++
